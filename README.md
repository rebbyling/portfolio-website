# My Portfolio Website
Hello! So this is a project I embarked on during my summer of 2020 during the pockets of free time I had.

I learnt how to code with HTML and CSS through online resources like Youtube videos and W3Schools, and I made the graphics on the website myself with Adobe Illustrator. It was definitely a long process with a lot of trial and error, but given that I have never done any front end development prior to this, I am pretty satified with how it turned out.

Of course there is still lots of room for improvement. Moving forward, I hope I will work to brush up on my javascript and work on making my website mobile friendly.
